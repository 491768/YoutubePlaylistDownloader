# IMPORTANT NOTE: THE PROGRAM CURRENTLY DOESN'T WORK
### I'm home only at weekends and I don't have much time to take care of this program, as a result, it is currently unstable, the portable version should work if you don't update the program, but if its broken too there is not much you can do until I release a fix.
