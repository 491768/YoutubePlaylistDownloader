Version 1.303:
- Fixed (hopefully) all the bugs with the new subscription system. 
  New features = new bugs, new bugs = new patches; sorry for that 

Version 1.3:
- Subscriptions! You can now subscribe to channels to automatically download their new videos
- More download options added; you can now download videos with higher fps rate than 30 and you can also choose to not convert audio to any format
- A new help page that includes more information about the subscriptions system and how it works. There is also information about how to contact me

IMPORTANT NOTE: all your settings (save location, themes and colors) will be reset after this update, this is one time only and will not repeat in the future.

*Version 1.301 fixes a small bug in the subscription system & Version 1.302 fixes some bugs with clean audio downloading
